      <p>All the way back in 1890, a distraught woman called Francisca Rojas claimed that someone had brutally stabbed her two young children to death in their rural home in Argentina. Her neighbour, who she was suspicious of, was quickly arrested and tortured to obtain a confession. He kept his mouth shut, so the investigators had to look into other ways to uncover the killer. The detective in charge went back to the scene of the crime and discovered a bloody fingerprint. He asked for a copy of the mother’s prints, and they quickly found a match. Thanks to their fingerprint research the mother immediately cracked and confessed to the murder! <br>
      She was the first person in the world to be found guilty through fingerprint evidence.</p>
